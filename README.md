## About
quickReads is a simple productivity app that allows the user to save web content that they'd like to visit later. 

Have you ever left open a bunch of tabs in your browser to keep track of content you'd like to view later but don't want to bookmark? Use quickReads instead! 

Ideal for keeping track of articles, videos, tutorials or job postings, just to name a few. quickReads allows you to quickly delete or complete your reads once you've viewed them. You can also mark the reads as favorites or important.

You can view the app live at https://biamess.github.io/quickReads/.

## Coming soon
In the works is pinning functionality, advanced sorting options, and much more.

## Notes
This app was built with React.
